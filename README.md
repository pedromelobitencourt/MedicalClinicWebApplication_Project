# Medical Clinic Web Application

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the **Medical Clinic Web Application** project. In this project, our team has developed a web application for a medical clinic. The application is organized into two main parts: one for restricted access, intended for the clinic's internal team, and the other for the general public.

## Project Overview

### General Public Access
The public-facing part of the application provides the following features:

1. **Home Page:** Displays general information about the clinic.
2. **Gallery:** Showcases fictitious photos of the clinic.
3. **New Address:** Allows users to submit their address details.
4. **Appointment Booking:** Enables clients to schedule medical appointments.
5. **Login Page:** Provides user authentication for staff and clients.

### Restricted Access
The restricted access part of the application includes screens/pages for the following:

1. **Patient Electronic Health Record (EHR) Registration:** Allows staff to create electronic health records for patients.
2. **Clinic Staff Registration:** Permits the clinic to add new staff members to the system.
3. **Patient Registration:** Enables the registration of new patients.
4. **List of Registered Staff:** Displays a list of all registered staff members.
5. **List of Registered Patients:** Displays a list of all registered patients.
6. **List of Registered Addresses:** Provides a list of all registered addresses.
7. **List of All Appointment Bookings:** Shows all appointment bookings made by clients.
8. **List of Appointment Bookings (for Doctors):** Displays appointment bookings only for the logged-in doctor, if applicable.
